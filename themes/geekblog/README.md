Geekblog is a simple Hugo theme for personal blogs. It is intentionally designed as a fast and lean theme and may not fit the requirements of complex websites. If a more feature-complete theme is required there are a lot of got alternatives out there. You can find a demo and the full documentation at [https://hugo-geekblog.geekdocs.de](https://hugo-geekblog.geekdocs.de).

## Build and release process

This theme is subject to a CI driven build and release process common for software development. During the release build, all necessary assets are automatically built by [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and bundled in a release tarball. You can download the latest release from the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekblog/releases).

Due to the fact that `gulp` is used as pre-processor the theme cannot be used from the master branch by default. If you want to use the theme from a cloned branch instead of a release tarball you'll need to install `gulp` locally and run the default pipeline once to create all required assets.

```Shell
# install required packages from package.json
npm install

# run gulp pipeline to build required assets
gulp default
```

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://hugo-geekblog.geekdocs.de/posts/getting-started/) for details about the different setup options.
